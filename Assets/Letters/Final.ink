I've been counting the days since the drone last gave its lovely signal. 
Perhaps it was always fated to be like this. 
A constant reminder of the vast distance between us. Regardless of whether or not you return, it is tortuous to be without you. 
But I'll be strong for you and the child.
I won't forget the tender moments, the passion, or the mistakes we've made along our way together.
Even the pain serves as a reminder of how deeply I love you.
