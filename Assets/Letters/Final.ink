There is no greater pain in this world than being forgotten. And there is no harsher sting than knowing your child doesnâ€™t know your touch. 
You swim in that vast ocean of stars a warrior, but you will be some distant memory to your lover who will dream of sweet tender memories with you as though they were like plays, repeated ad nauseam in a desperate attempt to keep you close to their heart. 
You will not see them walk. 
You will not be there to see them off to school. 
You might as well be as distant to your loved ones as the stars are to them in the starry sky.
